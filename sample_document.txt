Sample Document for RAG Testing

This is a sample text document to test the RAG application's ability to process TXT files.

Introduction
============

This document contains various sections that can be used to test the retrieval and question-answering capabilities of the RAG system.

Section 1: Technology Overview
==============================

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many industries. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Key concepts in ML include:
- Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled data
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
- Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with environment

Section 2: Natural Language Processing
=====================================

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.

Common NLP tasks include:
- Text classification
- Named entity recognition
- Sentiment analysis
- Machine translation
- Question answering

Section 3: Vector Databases
===========================

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are essential for applications like:

- Semantic search
- Recommendation systems
- Image similarity search
- Document retrieval

Popular vector databases include Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate, and Qdrant.

Section 4: RAG Systems
======================

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. The process involves:

1. Document ingestion and chunking
2. Vector embedding generation
3. Storage in vector database
4. Query processing and retrieval
5. Context-aware response generation

Benefits of RAG:
- Up-to-date information
- Reduced hallucinations
- Source attribution
- Domain-specific knowledge

Conclusion
==========

This sample document demonstrates various topics that can be used to test the RAG system's ability to understand, retrieve, and answer questions about the content.

You can ask questions like:
- What is machine learning?
- What are the benefits of RAG systems?
- Name some popular vector databases.
- What are common NLP tasks?
